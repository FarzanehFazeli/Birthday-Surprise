# 🎉 Console-Based Birthday Greeting in C++

A creative and heartfelt **birthday surprise app** written in pure **C++**, designed to simulate a warm, animated greeting directly in the terminal. From dynamic text effects to ASCII art and personalized messages, this project turns code into celebration.

🎯 Purpose Behind the Project

This isn’t just about animating strings on a screen—it’s about expressing care through code. I created this program for my dear friend **Razieh**, who’s also a programmer. I wanted her birthday to feel special in a way that matched her love for technology and creativity. 💖

If you’re reading this and wondering whether you can do something similar for your friend: **yes, absolutely!** You can personalize the message, colors, art, and even the tone to match whoever you’re celebrating. A few thoughtful lines of C++ might just become the most memorable gift you’ll ever give.
